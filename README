cottidie.vim
------------

Your quotidian Vim tip in 78 characters.

This Vim plugin brings friendly, syntax-highlighted Vim tips to your messages
area. At 78 characters these have enough substance to inspire but not enough
to distract. Try it out:

        :CottidieTip

The location of the tips file is configurable, so this plugin may also serve
you as a "daily tip" engine which draws from your own notes. (Not actually
daily though, it doesn't include any timing mechanism.)

The target audience is intermediate level. Contributions are welcome!

Installation
------------

Move the files into their respective directories inside your ~/.vim directory
(or your $HOME\vimfiles directory if you're on Windows).

With pathogen.vim the installation is as simple as:

        cd ~/.vim/bundle
        git clone https://github.com/glts/vim-cottidie.git cottidie
