cottidie.vim
------------

Your quotidian Vim tip in 78 characters.

This Vim plugin brings short, syntax-highlighted Vim tips to your messages
area. Try it:

:CottidieTip

The included tips are written in a style that I hope to be friendly and
motivating. The target audience is intermediate level.

The location of the tips file is configurable, so this plugin may also serve
you as a "daily tip" engine which draws from your own notes. (Not actually
daily though, it doesn't include any timing mechanism.)

Installation
------------

Move the files into their respective directories inside your ~/.vim directory
(or your $HOME\vimfiles directory if you're on Windows).

With the Pathogen plugin manager the installation is as simple as:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/glts/vim-cottidie.git cottidie
