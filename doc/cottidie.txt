DESCRIPTION					*cottidie*

This plugin brings friendly, syntax-highlighted Vim tips to your messages
area.  At 78 characters these have enough substance to inspire but not enough
to distract.

The location of the tips files is configurable, so this plugin may also serve
you as a "daily tip" engine which draws from your own notes.  (Not actually
daily though, it doesn't include any timing mechanism.)

						*:CottidieTip*
:CottidieTip[!]		Shows a tip in the messages area.  With the [!] the
			tip is also put in the |:messages| history but the
			output is less colourful.

It may be tempting to set this up to fire on the |VimEnter| event: >

	autocmd VimEnter * CottidieTip

Unfortunately, Vim's handling of |:echo| messages in autocommands is buggy, so
this may or may not work depending on what kind of Vim you are using.

SETTINGS					*cottidie-settings*

This plugin works out of the box as it comes packaged with a nice stockpile of
tips.  The tips sources can be adjusted with the following options.

						*g:cottidie_tips_files*
	g:cottidie_tips_files ~
	List of paths to tips files.  Any path Vim can |:read| is allowed,
	including remote paths like ftp://ftp.me.com/tips.txt.  Example: >

	let g:cottidie_tips_files =
	    \ ['~/mytips.txt', 'http://glts.github.io/vim-cottidie/tips']
<
	User-supplied tips are used in addition to the default tips, unless --

						*g:cottidie_no_default_tips*
	g:cottidie_no_default_tips ~
	Disable default tips.  Setting this to 1 disables loading of the
	default tips.
