DESCRIPTION					*cottidie*

Cottidie brings you Vim tips in as unobtrusive a way as possible.  At 78
characters, these have enough substance to inspire but not enough to distract.

The location of the tips file is configurable, so this plugin may also serve
you as a "daily tip" engine which draws from your own notes. (Not actually
daily though, it doesn't include any timing mechanism.)

						*:CottidieTip*
:CottidieTip[!]		Shows a tip in the messages area.  With the [!] the
			tip is also put in the |:messages| history but the
			output is less colourful.

It may be tempting to set this up to fire on the |VimEnter| event: >

    :autocmd VimEnter * CottidieTip

Unfortunately, Vim's handling of |:echo| messages in autocommands is buggy, so
this may or may not work depending on what kind of Vim you are using.

SETTINGS					*cottidie-settings*

This plugin works out of the box as it comes packaged with a nice stockpile of
tips.  The tips source can be adjusted with the following options.

						*g:cottidie_default_tips*
    g:cottidie_default_tips ~
    Path to default tips file.

    You can provide your own tips file.  Any path Vim can |:read| is allowed,
    including remote paths like http://glts.github.io/vim-cottidie/tips.

    The default tips file must contain the magic string "cottidie" or "tips"
    in the first three non-blank lines.  For the syntax see the included file.
    Leave this variable empty to disable the default tips file.

						*g:cottidie_extra_tips*
    g:cottidie_extra_tips ~
    List of paths to additional user-supplied tips files.  Example: >

	let g:cottidie_extra_tips =
	    \ ['~/mytips.txt', 'ftp://ftp.me.com/cottidie/tips']
<
    No validation takes place, file content is used as is.
